The Academy prides itself on the quality of its graduates compared to other institutes of learning, and proof that your understanding of the principles of Starlight manipulation will be needed for your Tome to allow access to further educational materials from the Archives. <NL>We all wish you luck on your journey! <NL>-The Faculty and Staff of the Academy of the Astral.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.SHRINES.name": "Academy Shrines",
  "astralsorcery.journal.SHRINES.1.text": "Areas determined by the Academy to be conducive to mental study have had shrines built there. These consist of two variants: Larger and more elaborate shrines that contain crystals useful to manipulating Starlight, and smaller shrines that are useful to smaller initiate study groups. Both types include storage with study supplies inside, though the exact contents may change based on the initiates who used that location last. The larger shrines are usually located in areas free of tree obstructions, such as deserts and colder mountain tops.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.SHRINES.2.text": "The larger shrines contain sample Collector Crystals useful for gathering and manipulating Starlight. Each has an attunement to one of the five constellations of the Bright classification, in order to be most beneficial to newer initiates just starting out in their studies. <NL>While flawless specimens in their own rights, these crystals are crafted from refined, but not pure, bases and so should not be expected to provide the same Starlight energy levels available to practiced crystal crafters who have highly refined their craft. These crystals cannot be enhanced in their performance due to this same issue.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.SHRINES.3.text": "Special wards have been placed to prevent initiates from carrying off or modifying these study tools to maintain the availability for all initiates in a region. <NL>The Academy reminds all initiates that Starlight cannot penetrate opaque, solid materials. While the Academy will install a roofed covering to protect the study areas against inclement weather and hostile creatures should the Academy need to close, this roof should be removed if the shrine is intended for utilization of the crystal within.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.CPAPER.name": "Constellation Papers",
  "astralsorcery.journal.CPAPER.1.text": "Inside the storage of Academy Shrines can be found study aids in the form of parchment. These parchments are attuned to the existing Academy archives and will reveal knowledge of an additional constellation to the user when first viewed, as long as their archives record indicates sufficient understanding of Starlight concepts. Due to this, duplicate records will not be generated for any given initiate. Excess study materials should be left behind for other initiates.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.CPAPER.3.text": "These papers can be stored within the Tome for future reference by opening the Tome while holding Shift. <NL>In the event an initiate would be so irresponsible as to lose their papers, the Academy will not be re-issuing these materials. Instead, the initiate may borrow a copy from another initiate, or recreate them once they have access to a sufficiently advanced crafting altar to properly infuse the constellation knowledge back into parchment. A relatively small cost for such a large lapse of judgment. Papers stored in the tome are accessible by the initiate from any other tome.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.WAND.name": "Resonating Wand",
  "astralsorcery.journal.WAND.1.text": "While the floating crystals in the shrines will naturally spill some of its internal Starlight onto nearby crafting tables thanks to the Academy's wards, other crystals will not. As this behavior is also fairly wasteful and magically messy, it will not suffice for more delicate crafting. One of the first tools any initiate should obtain is a wand that will allow them to control the release of Starlight energies from Starlight sensitive devices and crafting implements by right-clicking them.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.WAND.3.text": "Due to its sensitivity to gathered Starlight energies, the wand can be used at night to determine areas of conflicting Starlight resonance. The vibrations of this wand, when exposed to open Starlight at night, will reveal areas where the resonating frequency of the wand reveals areas deep underground where contained Starlight energies are contained by a §3crystalline form§r. <NL>These revealed areas appear as almost smokey areas of Starlight displacement above ground.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.WAND.4.text": "One final use of a Resonating Wand is that attempting to activate a Starlight device that requires a supporting structure built around it will alert the wielder when the supporting structure is incorrect. Due to the disruptions in flowing Starlight, missing or misplaced portions of the structure will be visually highlighted, allowing for rapid troubleshooting in the construction of these structures.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.ORES.1.text": "§8§nRock Crystal Ore:§r Deep underground near bedrock, the intense pressure can form incredibly rare and fragile crystals. These crystals have a unique internal structure that makes them particularly receptive to Starlight energies. Despite the relative fragility of these crystals, they are held within hard veins of rock that are prone to destroying the fragile crystals inside unless mined by a tool sufficiently hard itself, such as diamond. The resonation in Starlight energies becomes visible when holding a Resonating Wand",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.ALTAR1.name": "Luminous Crafting Table",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ALTAR1.1.text": "The purity of Starlight easily realigns the contents of materials into a more ordered and pure state for their intended purpose. By placing a crafting table near an Academy Shrine Collector Crystal, the wards will redirect Starlight and transmute the crafting table into a crafting instrument more suited to an initiate. Made of the purest marble, this entry-level altar table can cleanly absorb Starlight energy from the sky or a linked Collector Crystal, and redirect the magical energy into the crafting materials laid in it, instead of relying on a constant magically-messy flood of power.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ALTAR1.2.text": "In order to capture Starlight on its own, this table needs an unobstructed view of the sky directly above. It also lacks the required matrix that a Collector Crystal possesses to gather Starlight efficiently, and due to this is unable to compensate for atmospheric diffusion of Starlight energy. Measurements by the Academy indicate sea level is roughly the mid-point in diffusion losses, with bedrock showing nearly full diffusion loss of the energies. Atmospheric diffusion losses disappear at around twice the distance from bedrock as sea level itself.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ALTAR1.4.text": "If the table is above the atmospheric diffusion height, or other factors make raising the table higher are infeasible, relocating the table to another location in the world would be recommended. Starlight energies are not uniformly distributed from the heavens, and there are areas of the world with far more concentrated Starlight energies available than others. Thankfully, a recurrence of Icarian Famine has not repeated, and there are no recorded instances in modern times of locations with almost no Starlight energies over large areas by survey teams.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ALTAR1.5.text": "Once the items needed as ingredients for the crafting recipe are laid out within the table, right-clicking the table with a Resonating Wand will release the reservoir, flooding the ingredients with Starlight power. The resulting crafting item will be ejected from the table automatically once the crafting completes. The current reservoir of stored energy is displayed below the table item interface itself. Due to the volatility of Starlight,",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ALTAR1.6.text": "the storage does not function like a battery that charges over time, but instead reflects the current amount of ambient captured Starlight available for crafting. All but the most simple devices, tools, and material manipulations will require more Starlight than this table can safely redirect and provide with its reservoir. <NL>Once an initiate has used it to build the necessary tools to continue their education, they will also have gained sufficient knowledge in the needed Starlight concepts to improve upon this table, making it far more effective.",

Magically pristine and highly reflective of magical energies, this marble can be found in pockets underground. Other marbles with less magical purity cannot be used for the delicate energy control needed to work with Starlight. Carving channels in prescribed manners will alter how the marble channels nearby Starlight. <NL>While this is the same marble used by the Academy in all of its communal Shrines and other student gathering areas, the",
  "astralsorcery.journal.MARBLETYPES.2.text": "Academy strongly warns all initiates that stealing or defacing the marble used for Academy property will result in punishment to those caught by the faculty, up to and including being expelled from the Academy.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.SOOTYMARBLE.1.text": "By coating the surface of marble with a magical filtering element, such as coal dust, the marble itself can be changed beyond simply making it \"dirty\". The magical resonance of the marble is fundamentally changed in this way, so that even washing off the dust does not change the new appearance or efficacy of the marble, along with the qualities of the magical energy absorbed and reflected through that surface. This is most useful when attempting to channel larger volumes of Starlight by removing any impurities in their energy that may have been picked up during",

  "astralsorcery.journal.HAND_TELESCOPE.1.text": "Despite stars having a set location of appearance as they wheel overhead in the sky, certain recurring patterns and shapes will appear to those sensitive to the magical energies emanated by them. These magical constellations have their own schedule they appear within, which is linked to the phases of the moon. A specially crafted glass can be used to make these magical energies far more visible to the viewer. Despite being a rather simple device, the Looking Glass will facilitate viewing the strongest of these magical constellations, though the ebb and flow of",
  "astralsorcery.journal.HAND_TELESCOPE.4.text": "interfering energies from other constellations means that only one constellation will be visible to this tool on any given night. <NL>Staring at the night sky without any nearby obstructions is absolutely necessary, and the user must have at least seen one of these constellations traced out before. It is important that once the user believes they have located such a constellation that they hold shift in order to not move the Looking Glass at all, and then carefully trace the pattern of the constellation using left-click.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.HAND_TELESCOPE.5.text": "By not holding the Looking Glass absolutely still in this way, or without tracing with near-perfect accuracy the constellation, the magical pattern will not be truly §3discovered§r.

  "astralsorcery.journal.ILLUM_POWDER.1.text": "Glowstone is reactive to Starlight energy, even the small amount resonating within an Aquamarine. By crushing glowstone together with an Aquamarine, the resulting pile of dust is highly reactive with itself. Throwing this dust results in a magical light source being suspended in space. <NL>As a floating cloud of dust, it is harder to accidentally snuff than a torch, requiring smothering the light with liquid or a block.",

This is true whether thrown by sorcerer or dispenser.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.ILLUMINATOR.name": "Cave Illuminator",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ILLUMINATOR.1.text": "When large areas of darkness need illumination, Illumination Powder is insufficient. Not only does it require manual deployment, but it requires the sorcerer to travel into danger directly. Deploying Illumination Sparks using a Starlight-powered device is far better. <NL>By powering the device directly from the nighttime Fosic Field, or a more advanced initiate's Illumination Wand, the Cave Illuminator can provide light coverage over a wide area, in spiraling vertical layers 8 meters apart.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ILLUMINATOR.3.text": "To prevent unnecessary placement of Sparks, the Illuminator will only place Sparks in areas lower than the Illuminator itself, and only in places that are covered from the sky. If given sufficient time, it can illuminate all the way down to bedrock and will continue to place new Sparks in newly made empty spaces. <NL>Removing the Illuminator will leave the Sparks behind. As removing the sparks is labor-intensive, care should be taken when placing a Cave Illuminator to prevent lighting up areas that are undesired.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.ROCK_CRYSTALS.1.text": "Due to the special circumstances that create them, each newly mined Rock Crystal is different. These variances in size, purity of the crystal, and even shape of the facets can result in considerable differences in suitability for a purpose. There is no method to determine what these attributes will be for any given crystal before freed from its rocky prison, and while the Academy recognizes that modifications to these crystals are an incredibly important part of their use, it is not nearly as simple as shaping a normal gemstone's appearance.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ROCK_CRYSTALS.2.text": "Smashing a Rock Crystal's facets into something as crude as a grindstone would simply destroy them. Other, more refined, methods are needed for §8modifying§r a crystal.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.CRYSTAL_GROWTH.1.text": "Submerging a Rock Crystal into a pool of Liquid Starlight until absorbed can be used to repair or grow the crystal into a more robust version of itself, as the internal matrix is realigned and reinforced by the magical energies of concentrated Starlight. When this occurs, the Size of the crystal will increase.

  "astralsorcery.journal.TOOLS.1.text": "While particularly vulnerable to shear forces, Rock Crystals can be carefully shaped to channel background Starlight energies to become far more durable than metal tools. By using several crystals to specially craft common tools that channel background Starlight energies, these tools can be crafted to magically leverage the attributes of their component crystals.

This Liquid Starlight has many uses for a sorcerer, but trying to collect the faint amounts that naturally gather on Aquamarine gems or Crystals under normal concentrations is impossible.

This catalyst will be slowly degraded by the Starlight power channeled through it, generating liquid until it is disintegrated entirely.
