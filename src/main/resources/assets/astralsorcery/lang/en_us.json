  "astralsorcery.journal.SHRINES.1.text": "Scattered across the world are ancient shrines, built from marble by a civilization long past. Some of the most impressive shrines, featuring elaborate structures, have been located atop high hills and mountains, while smaller ones have been dug up from under the sands in deserts.<NL>While they don't seem to be very special at first, it's told that many of them harbor old and sacred treasures. Unlike the legends, however, only a few old chests and stories of strange floating crystals have ever been found.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.SHRINES.2.text": "The floating crystals are quite bizarre. They appear to emit a constant shimmering Starlight that flickers in an eerie and enchanting way.<NL>There is little doubt that these crystals are artificial. Their true age and origin is practically impossible to determine, but after some observation the crystal energies seem to be fixed in their alignment with the stars.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.SHRINES.3.text": "Not even the tiniest sliver can be chipped from the crystals in these shrines, even with the most destructive methods.<NL>The behavior of these crystals also seems strange. The light they emit appears to ebb and flow, like water, in response to certain objects being nearby. §3Maybe placing a crafting §3table close by would yield §3something interesting?§r",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.CPAPER.name": "Constellation Paper",
  "astralsorcery.journal.CPAPER.1.text": "Inside chests found in the scattered shrines across the land, explorers occasionally find blank scrolls. Removing one of these scrolls from the chest causes a name to appear across the top, along with a strange drawing that resembles some of the stars seen in the night sky.<NL>After collecting a number of them, it appears that each scroll shows a different set of stars, but eventually they begin staying blank.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.CPAPER.3.text": "On further inspection, it seems as though they are written and enchanted in such a way that they do not show charts that are already mapped, or in the reader's inventory. It would likely be prudent to leave the blank papers for other passing scholars, as there isn’t any other use you can find for them right now. <NL>Papers can be filed between the last few pages of the Astral Tome for easy access and organization. The filed papers can be retrieved by holding shift while opening the Astral Tome.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.WAND.name": "Resonating Wand",
  "astralsorcery.journal.WAND.1.text": "When using a crafting table near one of the strange crystals in the ancient ruins, the crystal focuses a single ray of Starlight onto the table. The light is dim, yet it seems to have an effect on the malleability and density of certain materials on the crafting table.<NL>This unlocks various crafting recipes that are not normally possible. The simplest of which is a basic wand that is capable of interacting with various types of Starlight sensitive devices.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.WAND.3.text": "The Resonating Wand also has some other curious properties. When it is held in either hand at night, it vibrates and emits energetic sparks of white light that gather in seemingly random locations around the surface of the land. Nothing seems out of place or special on the surface though... §3Maybe there's §3something deep underground?§r",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.ORES.name": "Ores",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ORES.1.text": "§7§nRock Crystal Ore:§r In the deepest reaches of the world, the intense heat and pressure form incredibly rare and fragile crystals. These crystals each have their own unique properties, and they seem to take in Starlight with unusual ease. Mechanical hands are far too clumsy to properly harvest these fragile crystals from their exceptionally hard rock prisons, and even collecting them by hand requires tools capable of mining some of the hardest materials to not shatter the crystals inside through excessive impacts.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.ORES.2.text": "Detecting these ores while underground seems to be a vain effort as they spawn in singular veins far and few in-between. The crystals have been noted to attract Starlight, despite being near bedrock. Maybe there is a tool that resonates with Starlight light to help prospect for ores?<NL>§1§nAquamarine Shale:§r Shaped by the continuous flow of water and Starlight over fragmented Rock Crystal, these small and fragile gems form in the sands of riverbeds and beaches. Usually they can be found close to the surface buried in patches of sand.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.ALTAR1.name": "Luminous Crafting Table",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ALTAR1.1.text": "Using a regular crafting table to interact with the Starlight emitted by the shrine crystal, which you have named \"Collector Crystals\" due to how they gather Starlight, seems to be inefficient. The table is only able to contain a small amount of Starlight from the crystal. Not only that, but the table must be very nearby the crystal or the collected Starlight rapidly bleeds out from it due to wood being inefficient for this purpose.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ALTAR1.2.text": "The Luminous Crafting Table solves both issues perfectly by being made of the purest marble. It is able to absorb and retain a much larger amount of Starlight than the crafting table. Also, it does not require a connection to a Collector Crystal to collect Starlight at all, as it has its own receptacle built within.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.ALTAR1.4.text": "The Luminous Crafting Table is not without its drawbacks, though. First, it needs to be placed somewhere above the ground with an unobstructed view of the sky in order to collect Starlight. Its collection process also seems to be temperamental, even with the clearest of skies.<NL>Placing the table higher in the sky allows it to collect more Starlight, with the atmospheric interference of Starlight seeming to disappear entirely at around twice the height of sea level. It also collects considerably more Starlight during the nighttime. The table's current Starlight reservoir is visible beneath its crafting grid.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ALTAR1.5.text": "In order to craft with the Luminous Crafting Table, the table must be right clicked with a Resonating Wand after the items for the recipe are placed in it. When the item is done crafting, the item will be ejected out of the table.<NL>The amount of Starlight collected by the table varies heavily from position to position within the world, ranging from almost no Starlight at all, to filling or even exceeding the reservoir.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.HAND_TELESCOPE.name": "Looking Glass",
  "astralsorcery.journal.HAND_TELESCOPE.1.text": "Despite the night sky constantly shifting all the time, certain recurring patterns and shapes appear on a regular basis. Many of these shapes bear a close resemblance to the patterns on the Constellation Papers found in ruined shrines.<NL> While no one is yet sure of their importance, the shapes of such Constellations were important enough for observers of old to carefully mark them in great detail. It might be prudent for a scholar to also mark and familiarize themselves with these patterns in the sky.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.HAND_TELESCOPE.4.text": "The Looking Glass, despite being a rather rudimentary device, goes a long way towards the process of investigating the night sky.<NL>In order to locate and trace Constellations, a clear view of the night sky is absolutely necessary. Also, a proper Constellation must have been discovered from the Constellation Papers. <NL>Once a possible pattern is found, the view angle of the telescope can be fixed by holding Shift. The pattern of stars can then be traced by using left-click to carefully draw lines between the stars.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.GRINDSTONE.name": "Grindstone",
  "astralsorcery.journal.GRINDSTONE.1.text": "A crafting table is useful and all, but to properly manipulate certain materials a more specialized tool is required. A Grindstone with a marble grinding wheel does exactly that. It allows for fine adjustments to the cut and polish of different types of crystals, as well as giving the ability to grind certain types of materials into dust.<NL>A material or object can be placed onto it and then ground by right-clicking. Right-clicking with Shift will remove the item if you have an empty hand to take the item.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.GRINDSTONE.3.text": "Handling Rock Crystals properly when trying to properly shape them and polish them is a bit of a tedious process. Frequent inspection when doing so is recommended, as inattentive grinding can reduce a crystal to nothing. Mechanical hands are incapable of operating this device due to the precision needed in crystal shaping.<NL>Perhaps things besides crystals can be sharpened in the Grindstone, as well.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.TOOLS.name": "Crystal Tools",
  "astralsorcery.journal.TOOLS.1.text": "After some careful testing, it becomes apparent that pure Rock Crystals are nowhere near as fragile as they appear, but only if properly handled and prepared. Tools crafted with them have much more durability than normal tools. Specifically, they don't seem to break from normal use. Crystal tools have the collective attributes of the crystals used to craft them, and their properties such as damage and mining speed are determined by how well shaped the crystals are.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.TOOLS.2.text": "Unfortunately, Crystal Tools are not perfect. Despite their apparent unbreakability they become dull or deform after constant use, causing them to deal less damage, mine blocks slower, etc. It is possible to sharpen and reshape them on a Grindstone to regain their lost attributes, but when ground they lose size similarly to individual Rock Crystals. To compensate for the lost mass, it is likely that Crystal Tools behave similar to Rock Crystals, with size being increased by submerging it in Liquid Starlight and letting it sit.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.TOOLS.3.text": "However, such artificial growth of Crystal Tools results in uncontrolled and deformed crystal growth, and sharpening of tools will again be necessary. It is not possible to increase the stats of a crystal tool above the baseline set when newly crafted, no matter how much it is ground or submerged in Liquid Starlight.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.ROCK_CRYSTALS.name": "Rock Crystal Properties",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ROCK_CRYSTALS.1.text": "Almost every newly mined Rock Crystal is unique. They vary in their size, crystal purity, and shape of their facets. There seems to be no way to determine what those will be during the mining process.<NL>While increasing the purity of Rock Crystals does not seem to be possible at the moment, grinding off small bits and shaping them with a Grindstone to seems easy enough.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.CRYSTAL_GROWTH.name": "Crystal Growth",
  "astralsorcery.journal.CRYSTAL_GROWTH.1.text": "Upon immersing single Rock Crystals into this strange, cold, and ethereal liquid, some of it clings onto the crystal.<NL>Upon closer inspection, it almost seems like the Liquid Starlight solidified on the surface though it quickly starts melting off again when removed, undoing the temporarily added mass. Leaving it in the liquid long enough might permanently increase its size? If a crystal were to be made larger, perhaps multiple of some items could be crafted from one crystal.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.CRYSTAL_GROWTH.2.text": "Crystals seems to have a maximum size they will grow to. You do wonder what would happen if a fully-grown crystal was continuously submerged in Liquid Starlight, and what it would mean for its purity.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.MARBLETYPES.name": "Marble",
  "astralsorcery.journal.MARBLETYPES.1.text": "A pristine and light-reflecting variety of marble can be found from time to time while mining underground. The ancient shrines are also built entirely from this marble, and its reflective capabilities seem to interact with Starlight in a promising manner.<NL>If the ancient builders recognized this marble’s importance in Starlight sensitive structures, then it is unlikely that a less pure marble from other sources would see the same results. Carving channels into the marble seems to alter the way it directs Starlight energy.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.SOOTYMARBLE.name": "Sooty Marble",
  "astralsorcery.journal.SOOTYMARBLE.1.text": "Coating the surface of marble with a very dark material, such as coal, will reverse its innate reflective properties into strong absorptive properties. Sooty marble collects sunlight during the day by heating up, and radiates it throughout the night. This marble may prove to be just as useful as white marble in the future, as the thermally radiated sun energies seem to improve the effects of starlight nearby.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.ALTAR2.name": "Starlight Crafting Altar",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ALTAR2.1.text": "The Starlight focusing abilities of the Luminous Crafting Table and addition of a Starlight reservoir make it a significant upgrade to a normal crafting table. However, even that can be improved upon. The table can be engineered into a larger altar with reinforced extensions designed to capture and support increased Starlight flow.<NL>In order to focus enough Starlight to actually make use of the extensions however, a large Starlight collection structure made of various types of marble is required.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.ALTAR2.4.text": "The Starlight reservoir in the crafting altar is not only greater in size compared to the Luminous Crafting Table, it has special properties that cause it to turn red if the collection structure around the table is incorrect, or incomplete.<NL>The newly upgraded altar will need to be placed in the center of the marble collection structure with an unobstructed view of the night sky, and the crafting materials arranged in the table. The crafting can then be started by right-clicking with the Resonating Wand.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.WELL.name": "Lightwell",
  "astralsorcery.journal.WELL.1.text": "At night, a strange crystalline liquid seems to collect on Aquamarine gems and Rock Crystals. On closer examination, the liquid is a condensate of pure energy derived from Starlight.<NL>A carefully carved basin of marble makes the collection of this liquid quite easy. The liquid emits a bright and pure light, feels very cold, and a bucket full of it weighs almost nothing. Standing in Liquid Starlight results in nightvision being bestowed on you until it evaporates away.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.WELL.3.text": "In order to use the Lightwell, an Aquamarine gem or Rock Crystal needs to be placed on top to condense Starlight into liquid. Gems and crystals used to gather Starlight will constantly degrade until the point of completely shattering, and cannot be retrieved.<NL>This Liquid Starlight seems to have interesting interactions with Rock Crystals and other liquids. Perhaps this warrants some experimentation.<NL>You cannot help but wonder if other materials in a Lightwell would produce other liquids.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.INFUSED_WOOD.name": "Infused Wood",
  "astralsorcery.journal.INFUSED_WOOD.1.text": "As infusing materials with Liquid Starlight empowers them, the versatility of strengthened wood would have great value in construction and crafting.<NL>Because it's an organic material, leaving it to soak in Liquid Starlight seems to have a different absorption pattern than the crystals, though the end result is the same: the starlight is drawn fully into the wood, though it may not be completely even in distribution. This could require some further investigation in the future, but for now functions sufficiently for your needs.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.ILLUM_POWDER.name": "Illumination Powder",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ILLUM_POWDER.1.text": "Glowstone and Aquamarine exhibit a strange reaction when brought in close proximity of each other. Tiny flame-like sparks rapidly flicker between both of them. These sparks can scatter quite far from their source before going out. Shattering Aquamarine into dust and mixing it with Glowstone dust creates a small pile of radiant powder, illuminating the space around it. This is an improved alternative to more commonly used torches, as it is harder to accidentally remove them, requiring the light be smothered with another block.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.NOC_POWDER.name": "Nocturnal Powder",
  "astralsorcery.journal.NOC_POWDER.1.text": "The night harbors many dangers and brings forth endless creatures with malicious intent. While those monsters are not often interesting by themselves, the things they carry with them are usually much more desirable.<NL>Unfortunately, those creatures either avoid daytime completely, or act friendly when under the light of day. Illumination Powder, if darkened sufficiently with additives, could be used to encourage these hostile monsters to spawn.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.NOC_POWDER.3.text": "While a block can be right-clicked to create this field of darkness for a few seconds, creating such an area in close proximity might not be a great idea. The powder can be thrown, much like the Illumination Powder, to create this darkness wherever it lands.<NL>Due to the concentrated effect the powder creates, placing them too close together minimizes their efficacy.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.SKY_RESO.name": "Fosic Resonator",
  "astralsorcery.journal.SKY_RESO.1.text": "Looking up in the sky with the naked eye, it is nearly impossible to discern the magnitude of Starlight emitted in a given area. However, there is empirical evidence based on the Luminous Crafting Table’s reservoir that the light sent by stars varies from position to position in the world; the light of one star can overlay with others causing it to either amplify in strength, or just vanish entirely.<NL>Altars and other structures that rely on Starlight can perform at a higher capacity in an amplified Starlight field.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.SKY_RESO.3.text": "Finding such positions by just plainly observing the sky or an altar’s reservoir at different positions seems tedious, time consuming, and ineffective.<NL>A better solution would be a device that resonates in the light spectrum visible to the naked eye while an amplified Starlight field is near. It does not replace the need for exploring to find a suitable place, but makes them easier to find by looking along the surface at night while holding the device. Early calculations show that areas of high Starlight are rare, and could be many hundreds of meters apart.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.SPEC_RELAY.name": "Spectral Relay",
  "astralsorcery.journal.SPEC_RELAY.1.text": "The Fosic Resonator can find fields of intense Starlight, useful for harnessing Starlight energies. The problem is that moving infrastructure or traveling vast distances to harness the Starlight can be impractical. As delving further into the secrets of the Ancients will undoubtedly require increasing amounts of Starlight, an alternative is in order until you can craft something to directly collect the Starlight for yourself.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.SPEC_RELAY.4.text": "A small structure, dedicated to collecting Starlight for the nearby altar, should solve that problem. A clear view of the sky is certainly a necessity, with better results achieved at night.<NL>When the relay has been placed high up, but close to an altar, it will collect and focus Starlight once a glass lens is placed inside it. The Starlight is then redirected as small sparks to the nearest altar.<NL>Placing Relays too close to each other will result in cannibalization of gathered Starlight, and will create much more... §odisappointing§r results.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.KNOWLEDGE_SHARE.name": "Written Expertise",
  "astralsorcery.journal.KNOWLEDGE_SHARE.1.text": "While gaining new knowledge is certainly important, recording said knowledge to preserve it for others, or possibly another civilization uncovering your remains thousands of years later that want to follow your path, is equally important.<NL>Right-click or shift-right-click to write down your knowledge onto an empty scroll or one that already has your writing on it.<NL>If only the Ancients would have left behind something like this in their shrines...",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.QUICK_CHARGE.name": "Alignment Charge",
  "astralsorcery.journal.QUICK_CHARGE.1.text": "While learning more about the patterns and effects of Starlight, the ever-present waves of Starlight become more and more perceivable during the ebb and flow of day and night.<NL>While in its current form, the blue-white energy is potent enough to suffice for smaller rods and wands to tap for channeling, a larger focus will be required to enhance the effects of single Constellations while channeling this energy.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.ATT_WANDS.1.text": "In the light of the new discoveries for crafting, maybe the divining wand that finds Rock Crystals can be slightly altered to serve an additional and better purpose.<NL>Infusing a wand with various materials under focused light might bring forth some more powerful effects.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ATT_WANDS.2.text": "As this is a delicate process, and the wand is not as amenable to changing its internal Starlight flow, the result is not be reversible or able to be overwritten with a different infusing attempt on the same wand, unlike the Mantles.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.ATT_WAND_ARMARA.name": "Wand Attunement: Armara",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ATT_WAND_ARMARA.1.text": "Resilient and protective, this combination of materials along with the Constellation energies imbues the wand with shielding properties. While holding it, it can be used as a shield, without the heavy clunkiness of a normal shield. When hit while actively shielding, you are granted additional protection against the damage.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.ATT_WAND_DISCIDIA.name": "Wand Attunement: Discidia",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ATT_WAND_DISCIDIA.1.text": "As the dangers of the night grow fiercer, they also become more resilient to strong attacks themselves. While holding a wand that's imbued with the effects of Discidia, consecutive successful attacks against the same target will deal significantly more damage for each hit.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.ATT_WAND_AEVITAS.name": "Wand Attunement: Aevitas",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ATT_WAND_AEVITAS.1.text": "A wand imbued with the aspects of Growth and Creation grants you the convenience of walking through air as a solid starfield will manifest itself below your feet, stopping you from falling into a deep cavern by accident.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.ATT_WAND_EVORSIO.name": "Wand Attunement: Evorsio",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ATT_WAND_EVORSIO.1.text": "While Evorsio is thankfully not strong enough to evaporate the world entirely by itself, the wand aligned with it brings forth parts of this power. When you break a block while holding it, blocks around the broken one with the same type could evaporate into their drops an instant afterwards.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.ATT_WAND_VICIO.name": "Wand Attunement: Vicio",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ATT_WAND_VICIO.1.text": "While freely flying through the air and reaching for the stars might not be achievable with this wand, it being exposed to the effects of Vicio certainly helps mimic that a bit. While holding right-click will charge it up like a bow, upon releasing it does not shoot an arrow through the air, but instead yourself.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.C_CHALICE.name": "Containment Chalice",
  "astralsorcery.journal.C_CHALICE.1.text": "While the Lightwell is functional, the small size of its basin can be problematic, especially considering how much Liquid Starlight the Infuser works through. Some method of compressing stored liquids is needed.<NL>Owing to the nature of the celestial energies, an elegant method to contain and move Liquid Starlight and other liquids is needed. An idea to accomplish this that is inspired by the smaller shrines of the Ancients, may just work.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.C_CHALICE.3.text": "As Liquid Starlight is highly energetic under compression, Resonating Gems were required to keep everything in check. Unfortunately, this also means that relocating a Chalice without first removing the stored fluid will result in the fluid being dispersed into the ether.<NL>Fortunately, the Chalice is able to draw Liquid Starlight from nearby Lightwells across the ethereal, though only the bottom seems safe to manually manipulate the contents of a Chalice.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.C_CHALICE.4.text": "The containment does not prevent the fluid from seeking escape, and ethereal tendrils of the fluid's essence will continually explore near the Chalice. These essence tendrils may improve the Infuser's absorptive performance.<NL>The essences of other fluids contained nearby seem far more ready to interact, much like the Infuser. Fluid interactions will generate from nearby Chalices containing appropriate liquids, with slower loss than would be expected from the raw liquids themselves.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.C_CHALICE.5.text": "Adding more Resonating Gems to counteract the escaping essence destabilizes the entire Chalice, rendering it useless. A slight power boost in the form of a redstone signal to a containing Chalice suffices to prevent essence escape, however.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.BORE_CORE.name": "Evershifting Fountain",
  "astralsorcery.journal.BORE_CORE.1.text": "While Liquid Starlight is a much more manageable and condensed form of the chaotic Starlight energies, it's condensed form is also rather inert.<NL>Releasing the stored energy in a controlled manner may allow for some useful channeling.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.BORE_CORE.2.text": "Building a device to contain the stresses of such a release will require the new crafting altar. Even still, shaping the release of those energies without destroying the device will need a focus ring, building on the Starlight flow principles used for crafting altars.<NL>Anything placed within that ring is likely to see obliteration from the chaotic energies, though.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.BORE_CORE.4.text": "As this Starlight \"Fountain\" operates using Liquid Starlight, a view of the sky is not needed. As the process of converting Liquid Starlight back to pure Starlight energy requires sufficiently delicate handling to prevent disaster, only by providing the Liquid Starlight from a Chalice directly atop the Fountain itself will suffice.<NL>Now that the conversion is handled, a new focus to \"prime\" the channeling of that energy is needed. Careful placement due to the ring will be needed.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.BORE_HEAD_LIQUID.name": "Neromantic Prime",
  "astralsorcery.journal.BORE_HEAD_LIQUID.1.text": "Essence states of fluids are odd things, frequently drifting down from above. It is likely that eons of this essence accumulation exist below Bedrock, ripe for the plunder if only you can get to them.<NL>The Neromantic Prime should prove capable of not only blasting away any blocks to bedrock, but will also ethereally penetrate the bedrock to draw the accumulated essence of these liquids up to the central Fountain-core for harvesting.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.BORE_HEAD_LIQUID.2.text": "While interaction mechanically with the Fountain-core is not possible, the retrieved fluidic essence can be drawn from the core using another empty Chalice, where it can be mechanically extracted.<NL>It seems the majority of the fluidic essence is that of water, which is not surprising. What is surprising is that the essence of water flows to fill all areas around the small pockets of other fluid essences, including the void left by extracting all of another fluid's essence.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.BORE_HEAD_LIQUID.4.text": "With no method to determine which essence is below, moving the Fountain structure constantly is tiresome, and also expensive in Liquid Starlight. With some tinkering, the Fosic Resonator should be able to sample this information instead.<NL>This improved Ichosic Resonator, drawing on Resonating Gem resonance to fluid, still only works during the night. Shifting modes between the old Fosic, and the new Ichosic, can be accomplished by shift-right-clicking.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.BORE_HEAD_VORTEX.name": "Fysallidic Prime",
  "astralsorcery.journal.BORE_HEAD_VORTEX.1.text": "The basic principle behind manipulating the energies from a Fountain focuses on shaping the natural tendency of Starlight energy to gather to itself.<NL>While the Neromantic Prime shapes the energies into a vertical stream that draws sympathetic liquid essences from below bedrock, you believe you've found another use in encouraging localized vortical currents.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.BORE_HEAD_VORTEX.3.text": "When turned back upon themselves and accelerated, these currents react with creatures in an odd fashion: drawing them up into the center of the vortex and \"locking\" them in place for as long as the vortex is powered by converted Liquid Starlight.<NL>While trapped in this Starlight vortex, the creatures seem largely unable to defend themselves, though the cost in Starlight to maintain this vortex is influenced by the strength of the creatures to fight back against its effects.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.BORE_HEAD_VORTEX.4.text": "Even mythical creatures are capable of being held by this Prime, though it seems to require the full and focused power of this Prime to do so.<NL>Additionally, it seems that some creatures require more Starlight power than a Lightwell is able to consistently provide over a prolonged time, and so certain creatures may not be contained for long; only as long as the internal reservoir of the Fountain lasts.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.ENCHANTMENT_AMULET.name": "Resplendent Prism",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ENCHANTMENT_AMULET.1.text": "Experimentations with Starlight show that shifting stars seem to react in strange patterns, halting the shifting of their normally chaotic magical energies when exposed to filtered Starlight.<NL>With the emanating power no longer constantly in flux, a more focused benefit may be achieved.<NL>Directing these energies into an Eye of Ender causes them to softly radiate and diffuse outwards a short distance, rather than harshly piercing their surroundings.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ENCHANTMENT_AMULET.3.text": "While worn, such a prism adds or empowers magical effects applied to the rest of the wearer's equipment.<NL>The exact nature of this empowerment seems random and based entirely on the magical frequency to which the shifting star was locked.<NL>Re-exposing this prism to more filtered Starlight seems to release the frequency lock, and select a new one, with the uncontrollable chaos of the shifting star itself determining the magical results.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.SEXTANT.name": "Sextant",
  "astralsorcery.journal.SEXTANT.1.text": "Due to the exacting nature of the structures required to manipulate Starlight energy flow, sometimes it can be maddening to constantly double-check the architecture of a structure when things aren't going right.<NL>By modifying a navigational sextant to be sympathetic to magical starlight energies, you end up with a tool that helps navigate the placement of structure blocks, even going as far as to indicate when materials have been misplaced.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.SEXTANT.3.text": "Because of the energy signatures involved, the Sextant is also able to pick up on the resonations of the Ancients, guiding you to various structures they left behind.<NL>You cannot help but feel the faint draw of something unknown and far beyond your perception when holding this Sextant...",
  "astralsorcery.journal.SEXTANT.4.text": "While holding the sextant to your eye, you are able to see those energies coalesce as a star in the sky at night. Dragging and dropping the structure onto the star displayed will \"lock\" the sextant onto it's location if the color frequencies match, allowing you to easily navigate to it during the night. Selecting a different star and locking its frequency will change your navigational target for that sextant. Imagine holding one in each hand...",

  "astralsorcery.journal.SEXTANT_UPGRADE.1.text": "Building on the resonant interactions with the energies of the Ancients, additional functionality of the Sextant could expand its value.<NL>By focusing in on the resonating energies of other civilizations and chunks of the world, the Sextant can be used to guide you to other structures, or even specific convergences of the natural world.<NL>The draw is worryingly stronger now, if only you could find a path...",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.OBSERVATORY.name": "Observatory",
  "astralsorcery.journal.OBSERVATORY.1.text": "While the Telescope has served well for finding the more difficult Dim Constellations, you feel something beckoning to you from even further beyond.<NL>Your experience with manipulation of Starlight leads you to believe you can construct a device that can let you search across the worlds themselves, though it will take considerable usage of filtered lenses and reactive powders to do so.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.OBSERVATORY.3.text": "With a much broader field of view than the Telescope, the Observatory allows you to follow the path of Starlight back to its source, no matter the distance. From the depths of the Astral, you can see there are more Constellations shining forth, though their light is very Faint and almost indistinguishable from the background noise of existence at this range.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.OBSERVATORY.4.text": "While it is unlikely the light finally filtering to you is sufficient to fuel a Ritual, you feel confident that it could be used to enchant items or potions. They may be too distant for crystal attunements, but there may be a way around that.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.ATT_TRAIT.name": "Enhanced Crystal Attunement",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ATT_TRAIT.1.text": "Your earlier suspicions concerning the Faint Constellations proved true, their light is too weak to fuel a ritual or even a full crystal Attunement. The spectrum of their light, however, leads you to believe that modification of existing Attunements may be possible.<NL>By ensuring the desired Faint Constellation is in the sky and setting the relays in the correct space, the Attunement Altar will react to their power.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ATT_TRAIT.2.text": "By placing an already Attuned crystal into the Attunement Altar, the Starlight of the Faint Constellation will alter the properties of the Attuned crystal, modifying the effects of rituals using that crystal.<NL>Additional information about the traits that can be applied have been added to the Faint Constellations in the Constellations tab.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.ENH_SHIFTING_STAR.name": "Irradiant Star",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ENH_SHIFTING_STAR.1.text": "The problem with the Shifting Star is that it purges all attuned starlight from the body.<NL>By focusing the energies of the Shifting Star into alignment with one of the Bright Constellations, this loss can be mitigated as the resonance is shifted to a new root to match the Star used. This allows gathered starlight to be directed via meditation into new perk resonances without having to start over from nothing.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.RESONATOR_AREA_SIZE.name": "Domic Resonator",
  "astralsorcery.journal.RESONATOR_AREA_SIZE.1.text": "With further alterations, the Resonator can be altered to show starlight displacement. This manifests in an ethereal field becoming visible while holding this new Resonator, not entirely unlike light through a soap bubble, that shows how far the natural starlight distributions are disturbed by buildings or rituals that channel or alter starlight.<NL>Shift-right-clicking still cycles through the modes, as before.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.ATT_PERKS_SEAL.name": "Perk Sealing",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ATT_PERKS_SEAL.1.text": "While the Irradiant Star is a major improvement in allowing for redirection of the infused starlight within the body, sometimes it's not enough to simply route the limited starlight flows around certain resonations. To that end, a Sealing Sigil can be used to \"mask\" or otherwise retard certain effects, acting as a removable \"off-switch\" or bridge over an effect not desired at that moment.",

  "astralsorcery.journal.node.ATT_PERK_GEMS.name": "Dynamism Gems",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ATT_PERK_GEMS.1.text": "The problem with trying to store starlight power in a crystal is that it rapidly drains away as light. By doping the crystal with the proper catalyst, storing starlight is possible after a fashion. Soaking Rock Crystals with glowstone powder in liquid starlight results in a crystal cluster that more easily contains the stored energies.<NL>For the same reason that the energy is able to be stored, it is equally difficult to directly access.",
  "astralsorcery.journal.ATT_PERK_GEMS.2.text": "Instead of directly accessing the power, leveraging the internal starlight power anchored in an infused body provides the perfect sympathetic circuitry to gain power from the crystal's resonations.<NL>Placing a Dynamism Gem into a specially allocated \"socket\" of that network will enhance the body further. The gem is bound to the flesh while socketed, but can be removed or replaced with another with little effort.",
